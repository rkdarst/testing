# Conclusions and recommendations

- Explore and use the good tools that exist out there
- Automatize. Automated tests enable faster feedback and reduce the number of surprises
- Strike a healthy balance between unit tests and integration tests
- Require that new functionality comes with new tests
- When you discover and fix a bug, also commit a test against this bug
- Use code coverage analysis to identify untested code or dead wood
