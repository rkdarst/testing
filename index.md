# Automated testing

In this lesson we will discuss why testing needs to be part of the software
development cycle and how such a cycle can be implemented. We will exercise a
collaborative testing/code review workflow.


## Prerequisites

1. You need [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org) (as part of Anaconda or Miniconda or Virtualenv).

2. Basic understanding of Git.

3. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

4. You will also need a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) account
   but you can sign into it with
   your [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
